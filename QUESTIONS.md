# QUESTIONS.md — Ambiguities requiring human decision

These items were identified during the compliance audit. The Reference Documents are either ambiguous, contradictory, or silent on these points. Per CLAUDE.md rules: no guessing — wait for human answer.

## Q1: Control access pattern — RESOLVED

**Decision:** Standardize on `state["control"][sid]`. All `sp.get("British_Control")`, `sp.get("Patriot_Control")`, and `sp.get("Rebellion_Control")` removed. `board/control.py` no longer sets per-space legacy flags.

## Q2: Card 70 (British Gain From French in India) — RESOLVED

**Decision:** Bot-specific removal per each faction's reference document:
- British: Remove French Regulars from WI, then spaces with British pieces.
- French: Remove British Regulars from spaces with Rebels.
- Indian: Remove French Regulars from Village spaces first.
- Patriot: Remove British Regulars from spaces with Patriot pieces.

## Q3: Queued vs immediate free ops — RESOLVED

**Decision:** Always immediate execution. Engine's `handle_event()` now drains all queued free ops immediately after the event handler returns, during event resolution.

## Q4: Brilliant Stroke (Cards 105-109) — RESOLVED

**Decision:** Full implementation per Manual §2.3.8, §2.3.9, §8.3.7.

Implemented:
- Trump hierarchy: ToA > Indians > French > British > Patriots
- Trumped BS cards return to owners (mark_bs_played → False)
- Bot auto-check before 1st eligible acts (bot_wants_bs conditions)
- Bot BS execution: LimCom + SA + LimCom, leader in space with pieces
- Treaty of Alliance: preparations > 15 (Available French Regs + all Blockades + half CBC)
- All factions become Eligible after BS resolves
- Simultaneous bot BS resolved via trump hierarchy

## Q5: Indian bot I10 March — RESOLVED

**Decision:** Implement ALL flowchart movements (not single move). The Indian bot March should attempt up to 3 movements per the flowchart bullets.

**Status:** Not yet implemented — documented for future work.

---

## Q6: French bot F5 — RESOLVED

**Decision:** Agent Mobilization first, Hortalez as fallback. The current code already implements this correctly.
